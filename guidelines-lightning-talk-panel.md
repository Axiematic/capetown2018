## Lightning Talk Panel Guidelines

The panel should agree on what criteria they will be applying to assess the student lightning talks. Here are some things to consider:

- relevance (does the talk relate to R?);
- originality;
- quality of material;
- quality of presentation; and
- use of allocated time.

During the afternoon tea break the panel should briefly convene to discuss their assessments and decide who wins the competition.

The panel needs to elect somebody to announce and present the prize at the end of the conference.
