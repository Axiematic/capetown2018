    <h3 class="center">Shiny</h3>
    <h4>Julia Silge</h4>

    <p>
        <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> is a framework for building interactive web apps and dashboards using
        the statistical programming language R. In this workshop, we will walk through how to move from an analysis performed
        in R, with plots and tables that an analyst wants to share, to a self-contained web app. We will learn:

    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>what reactive programming is,</li>
        <li>how to use the flexdashboard package to customize your app, and</li>
        <li>how to publish and share your app.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>Attendees should bring a laptop with the latest versions of <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> and
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download">RStudio</a> installed, and we will build a Shiny app
        from scratch together.</b>
    </p>

    <h3 class="center">Git with R</h3>
    <h4>Jennifer Bryan</h4>

    <p>
        Using Git and GitHub with R, RStudio and R Markdown.
        <br/><br/> Data analysts can use the <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git version control system</a> to manage a motley
        assortment of project files in a sane way (e.g. data, code, reports, etc.). This has benefits for the solo analyst
        and, especially, for anyone who wants to communicate and collaborate with others. Git helps you organize your project
        over time and across different people and computers. Hosting services like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, 
        <a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com">GitLab</a> provide a home for 
        your Git-based projects on the internet.
    </p>

    <p>What's special about using R and Git(Hub)?</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the active R package development community on GitHub</li>
        <li>workflows for R scripts and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> files that make it easy to share
            source and rendered results on GitHub</li>
        <li>Git and GitHub-related features of the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop">RStudio IDE</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The tutorial will be structured as ~5 task-oriented units. Indicative topics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The most difficult part: installation and configuration!</li>
        <li>Creating a Git repository and connecting the local repo to a GitHub remote, for new and existing projects.</li>
        <li>The intersection of GitHub and the R world: R packages developed on GitHub and how to make use of 
        <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues">issues</a>; <a href="http://www.r-pkg.org">METACRAN</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/cran">read-only mirror</a> of all CRAN R packages; R-specific search tips.</li>
        <li>Daily workflows and FAQ: how often should I commit?, which files should I commit? how do I change a commit or its
            message? how do groups of 1, 5, or 10 people structure their work with Git(Hub)? etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>This will be a hands-on tutorial, so bring your prepared laptop and pre-register a free GitHub account.</b></p>

    <h3 class="center">Building and Validating Logistic Regression Models</h3>
    <h4>Steph Locke</h4>

    <p>This workshop will take you through building a robust and reproducible logistic regression model from end-to-end. Starting from data ingestion to a fully documented model, we'll be covering:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> The fundamentals: what logistic regression models are and what they're good for.
        <li> Data preparation techniques including univariate analysis, normalisation, binning, and feature engineering.
        <li> Sampling techniques including simple methods and bootstrapping.
        <li> Model generation including automated feature selection methods, and addressing performance issues.
        <li> Model validation including common model measures, out of time samples, and analysis of groups.
    </ol>
    <p>All of this will be done within a reproducible framework using R and markdown. It is intended for people who would like to deepen their understanding of building models and be able to reproduce their results, especially for academic or regulatory reasons.</p>

    <p>This is a hands-on workshop with an emphasis on the practical implementation of techniques so you should be relatively comfortable coding with R and have used rmarkdown or knitr before. You should also bring a laptop with the latest versions of <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download">RStudio</a> installed.</p>
