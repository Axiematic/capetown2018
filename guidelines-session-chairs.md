## Session Chair Guidelines

Your responsibilities as a session chair are to:

- ensure that all speakers for your session are present and that you know who they are;
- introduce the talks (title of the talk and the speaker);
- keep track of time and notify speaker; and
- help handle questions at the end of the talk.

To help give timing feedback to the speakers you'll be provided with flashcards. For keynote and standard talks you should notify the speaker when they have 10, 5, 2 and 1 minutes remaining. For lightning talks you should notify the speaker when they have 2 and 1 minutes to go.

When a speaker is out of time, stand up and make it clear to the speaker that they need to bring things to a close rapidly.
